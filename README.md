Features for the 0-1 knapsack problem

This repository contains the features described in the paper "Jooken, J., Leyman, P., & De Causmaecker, P. (2023). Features for the 0-1 knapsack problem based on inclusionwise maximal solutions. European Journal of Operational Research, 311 (1), 36-55"

The features were calculated for two datasets of problem instances from the papers "Jooken, J., Leyman, P., & De Causmaecker, P. (2022). A new class of hard problem instances for the 0–1 knapsack problem. European Journal of Operational Research, 301 (3), 841–854." and "Pisinger, D. (2005). Where are the hard knapsack problems? Computers & Operations Research, 32, 2271–2284.". For both datasets, all features are available in raw form (allFeaturesJooken.csv, allFeaturesPisinger.csv) and normalized form (allFeaturesJookenNormalized.csv,allFeaturesPisingerNormalized.csv).

A subset of these features (MATILDAInput.csv) was used to perform an instance space analysis using the tool MATILDA (https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/). The folder "MATILDAOutput" contains images that are the result of using this tool.
