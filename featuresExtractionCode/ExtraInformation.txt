This folder contains the code to compute the features from the paper "Features for the 0-1 knapsack problem based on inclusionwise maximal solutions".
There are three programs (calcFeatures1.cpp, calcFeatures2.cpp and bouknap.c) and the source code of each program contains an instruction on the first line to compile the program.
The programs "calcFeatures1.cpp" and "calcFeatures2.cpp" expect their input in the same format (an example of such a problem instance is given in the file "problemInstanceFormatForCalcFeatures1And2.in"
The program "bouknap.c" expects its input in a different format (an example of such a problem instance is given in the file "problemInstanceFormatForBouknapExecutable.in)
